# Grader for Data Structures

This repository contains the source code for a grader used in data structures problems.

## Compiling the Grader (C++)
To compile the grader using g++ (for C++), run the following command:

```sh
g++ -o filename filename.cpp
```

Replace `filename` with the actual name of your source file and output executable.

## Testing with Large Input
Test large input using an input file, run the following command:

```sh
filename < (PATH_TO_INPUT.TXT)
```

### Example:

```sh
billboard < ../../input.txt
```
